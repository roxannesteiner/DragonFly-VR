# DragonFly-VR
Redefining how people experience real-world environments through immersive, data-driven visualization.

# Software Engineer â€“ 3D Visualization / VR Rendering (Early-Stage Startup)Â 

- Location:Â Remote (preference for candidates in the U.S. or Europe)Â 
- Engagement:Â Contract-to-collaboration (part-time or project-based, with potential for equity)Â 
## About the ProjectÂ 
Weâ€™re an early-stage startup developing a next-generation platform that redefines how people experience real-world environments through immersive, data-driven visualization. Our goal is to modernize an industry thatâ€™s overdue for innovation â€” combining 3D technology, virtual interaction, and smart insights into one seamless user experience. 

Weâ€™re looking for a technically curious, creative, and ambitious engineer whoâ€™s excited to work on bleeding-edge visualization technology. Youâ€™ll collaborate directly with the founder to help bring an early prototype to life, shape technical direction, and define how users will interact with immersive environments at scale.Â 

## Key ResponsibilitiesÂ 
- Design and develop components for a real-time 3D visualization / virtual tour experience
- Build and optimize rendering pipelines using modern approaches (e.g., neural rendering, Gaussian splatting, photogrammetry)Â 
- Integrate captured visual data into interactive 3D environments (desktop, web, or VR)Â 
- Collaborate on technical architecture decisions and proof-of-concept prototypesÂ 
- Maintain a focus on scalability, usability, and performanceÂ 
- Develop and establish an IT infrastructure that enables high-performance and high-throughput at scale for maximizing the user experience and minimize turnaround time.
Â 
Â 
## QualificationsÂ 
- Education:Â 
    PhD, Masterâ€™s, or strong research background inÂ Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, or Applied AI,Â orÂ equivalent professional experience in 3D visualization and rendering systemsÂ 

- Experience
    - 3+ years in computer graphics, VR/AR, or 3D software developmentÂ 
    - Experience with one or more rendering engines (Unity, Unreal, Three.js, or custom pipelines)Â 
    - Familiarity with neural rendering concepts (NeRF, Gaussian splatting, or similar 3D reconstruction techniques)Â 
    - Strong understanding of spatial computing, camera geometry, or point cloud processingÂ 
    - Proficiency in C++, Python, or JavaScript/TypeScriptÂ 
    - Experience with 3D data formats (OBJ,Â glTF, PLY, etc.)Â 
    - Comfort working in small, fast-moving environments with autonomyÂ 
Â 
## Ideal TraitsÂ 
  - Youâ€™re excited by early-stage ambiguity and creative problem solvingÂ 
  - You enjoy experimenting with new rendering or AI-driven visualization techniquesÂ 
  - You can bridge academic research with real-world applicationÂ 
  - You value clear communication and collaborative iterationÂ 
  - You want to be part of something transformative
Â 
## CompensationÂ 
This is an early-stage opportunity. Compensation will begin as aÂ paid project or consulting engagement, with potential for expanded collaboration orÂ equity participationÂ based on mutual fit and milestones.Â 
Â 
Â 
## How to ApplyÂ 
If youâ€™re passionate about immersive tech and want to help shape the future of how people experience real-world spaces, weâ€™d love to hear from you.Â
